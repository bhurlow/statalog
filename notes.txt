### DataScript notes 


query is achieved by:
  - reduces over each clause, modifying a context variable
  - for each clause it creates a "relation" which is a tuple of the 
    parts of the query and the (filtered | searched) datoms that match 
    the pattern 
  - filtering of the coll is accomplished by
      - mapping the array index to the value being tested
      - filtering coll if a[i] = v
  - each relation is hash-joined into the context
    building up a single relation which maps across all logic vars
  - the find specification is then evaluated on the summed relation
